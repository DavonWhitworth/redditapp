I\u2019m not one to make long posts like this but I do not have peers IRL that are in this field. Summary at the end if you don\u2019t want to read the novel.\n\nJust a little backstory to understand where I am coming from and why I\u2019m posting in the first place:\n\nI was an audio engineer/producer/in bands for over a decade focusing mainly on mastering but did mixing and some recording as well. Even though I worked my absolute ass off, got as many clients as possible, and was constantly networking, which did lead to moderate success, it didn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a niche industry that is ironically quite over saturated making it unsustainable as a solo gig as I had to supplement income by working 3-4 nights in a kitchen. Combine that with other issues like losing my studio (long story involving being fucked over by someone), my band breaking up, and having to file for a consumer proposal, amongst other bullshit that was going on in my life with a general loss in love for making music and dealing with artists as clients, I decided to call it quits in 2019, which In retrospect was a great decision given how COVID really fucked things up for the music industry.\n\nSo like a lot of people at that time,\n\nand even before covid, I had an interest in coding and wanted to shift careers anyway, so I looked into coding Bootcamps as I wanted to get in the industry the quickest way possible, however, I was immediately turned off, not only because they seem to pigeonhole you into web dev, they remind me of the same audio engineering/music production \u201cschools\u201d that were popping up around the 2008-2014 bedroom producer era, promising a career but also not elaborating on the difficulty of actually getting you a foot in the door.\n\nThankfully I never went to said schools and took the self-taught route for audio, which inspired me to take the same route for programming since audio (especially when working with windows) forced you to be computer savvy and I just developed a general love for computers and tech. I decided to do App Academy Open because research said web is the lowest barrier to entry, did the intro to programming which went well, but then the next module had a huge spike in difficulty and asked a ton of Logic-based questions (which were not web-related) that I just could not wrap my head around, which, at the time, made me feel incredibly discouraged.\n\nSince I was not that into web dev any way and have way more interest in games/graphics/ML/AI/digital audio, I decided that I needed more fundamental logic skills and training and wanted to take the school route instead, so I started to upgrade my high school math and work towards my GED so that I could get into the 2 year co-op diploma program at BCIT in Vancouver.\n\nOne thing to not if it isn\u2019t already obvious is that I am a high school drop out and my whole life I NEVER was good in school and in general just had a Fucked up upbringing, but to my luck, I dont just excel at math I also really ENJOY it and am sitting at a 95% average in PRE-CALC. At this time, I decided to also simultaneously learn web dev from a different set of courses alongside my math since I heard that school does not really teach programming, and I did manage to finish the HTML/CSS course and built a responsive web page, as well as a few simple games in pure C++ and unreal from Udemy courses, however, this quickly was proving itself to be impractical and inefficient, as I was and still am working 40+ hours a week, and trying to code in the evening after an 8 hour shift and 2-3 hours of math in the morning is exhausting. I decided to stop a few months ago to focus on finishing math just to get it over with since i will be finished upgrading by fall.\n\nThings were going well and Doing math with some programming was very empowering and made me infinitely more confident about my intelligence, but unfortunately, poor financial luck has recently struck again, long story short because of CERB related issues here in Canada (not to mention our government shit financial management but I digress) I now owe the government 4k on top on my remaining consumer proposal payments, which has basically fucked over my plans to start school in the fall as I need to get a second job, and, the 2 year program is no longer viable as it\u2019s full time and made very clear in the program that having a full time job, let alone 2, will compromise your school work. There is a part time program that has pretty much no barrier to entry but it\u2019s pay per course, and with the average price being 5-700 dollars it\u2019s significantly more expensive than the 2 year diploma.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, coincidentally about a week after finding out this news, I ran into an old freind who basically did the self taught web journey and got their foot in the door in only a year as a front end dev, then I shit you not a couple days later, ANOTHER freind who did a Bootcamp and now basically intern with good pay at a start up. Combine this with recession paranoia and hearing about hiring freezes In the industry, I practically had a mental breakdown because I feel as if the last 2 years has been a huge waste of time learning math when I should have just bit the bullet and put all my focus into programming, but even if I drop math now and focus of front end, the industry is saturated as fuck with junior devs now racing to get a bite at the tit, and, I still know I won\u2019t feel as full-filled in web as being in The other aforementioned fields of interest.\n\nThis is when I finally ask, god forbid, has ANYONE been in a situation like this? Do any senior devs out there have any advice of what path that is relatively LOW RISK an insolvent 35 year old with very little time and money but a huge interest for math, games, 3d graphics, ML/AI, digital audio should take? Is it even possible to find a career that intersects of all these fields that you can attain SELF TAUGHT or will I have to work 2 jobs for 2-3 years to pay for school? (keep in mind I am insolvent and can\u2019t take out a loan/ my family has no money as my parents are dead bears and one is an ex addict)? Should I just bite the bullet and learn web dev in whatever free time I have while working 2 jobs just to get my foot in the door or should I focus on passion and interests? Are there even transferable skills for people who have 10 years of audio experience into programming? I know it\u2019s a lot of questions but this is my Hail Mary at this point and I feel so beyond fucked by things I can\u2019t control.\n\nAny advice of any kind would be amazing and thank you so much for reading all of this if you did.\n\n**Summary of everything in question form**\n\nI\u2019m 35, an ex-audio engineer/producer that has very little money or means to get anymore than I make (I work 40+ hours a week), I am insolvent and ridden with government/consumer debt and need a better career via the self-taught coding path that is relatively low risk and TIME EFFICIENT that is optimally not web dev to get out of this hell I am in so I can make the life I want for myself and my GF. If it takes 2 years or more THATS FINE, if the learning is difficult THATS FINE. I don\u2019t need to know what language does what for what as I have done all that research, I just need to know what the path of least resistance (not in difficulty but in terms of time and money) that is not web dev related into, a career in software engineering, I can\u2019t waste my time again like I feel I did with learning math first to get into school which I can no longer do because of being fucked over by the government.\n\n* what are the possible 100% self-taught paths that are not Web dev related that I can take that align with my interests? (Games/game engines/3d graphics/ML/AI/Digital audio). Remember loans and school are not an option now it has to work 100% self-taught.\n* is game development actually as shitty as everyone says even if I focus on the engine/audio programming and not the design aspect? I have a strong interest but again I am not willing to take a huge risk to get into a career that supposedly pays shit and has long hours only to be potentially laid off is a project doesn\u2019t work.\n* Does anyone else go from audio engineering to programming? Are there even jobs in audio/programming that are lucrative and not super niche? Since I have over a decade in this field I am hoping there are some kind of transferable skills from audio to programming.\n* school is not a viable option in the near future so should I bother with math even with my skills? Where can they take me from a self-taught perspective? Can you even get into graphics/ML/AI without a PhD?",

I decided to do App Academy Open because research said web is the lowest barrier to entry, did the intro to programming which went well, but then the next module had a huge spike in difficulty and asked a ton of Logic-based questions (which were not web-related) that I just could not wrap my head around, which, at the time, made me feel incredibly discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I was not that into web dev any way and have way more interest in games/graphics/ML/AI/digital audio, I decided that I needed more fundamental logic skills and training and wanted to take the school route instead, so I started to upgrade my high school math and work towards my GED so that I could get into the 2 year co-op diploma program at BCIT in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing to not if it isn\u2019t already obvious is that I am a high school drop out and my whole life I NEVER was good in school and in general just had a Fucked up upbringing, but to my luck, I dont just excel at math I also really ENJOY it and am sitting at a 95% average in PRE-CALC. At this time, I decided to also simultaneously learn web dev from a different set of courses alongside my math since I heard that school does not really teach programming, and I did manage to finish the HTML/CSS course and built a responsive web page, as well as a few simple games in pure C++ and unreal from Udemy courses, however, this quickly was proving itself to be impractical and inefficient, as I was and still am working 40+ hours a week, and trying to code in the evening after an 8 hour shift and 2-3 hours of math in the morning is exhausting. I decided to stop a few months ago to focus on finishing math just to get it over with since i will be finished upgrading by fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Things were going well and Doing math with some programming was very empowering and made me infinitely more confident about my intelligence, but unfortunately, poor financial luck has recently struck again, long story short because of CERB related issues here in Canada (not to mention our government shit financial management but I digress) I now owe the government 4k on top on my remaining consumer proposal payments, which has basically fucked over my plans to start school in the fall as I need to get a second job, and, the 2 year program is no longer viable as it\u2019s full time and made very clear in the program that having a full time job, let alone 2, will compromise your school work. There is a part time program that has pretty much no barrier to entry but it\u2019s pay per course, and with the average price being 5-700 dollars it\u2019s significantly more expensive than the 2 year diploma.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To add salt to the wound, coincidentally about a week after finding out this news, I ran into an old freind who basically did the self taught web journey and got their foot in the door in only a year as a front end dev, then I shit you not a couple days later, ANOTHER freind who did a Bootcamp and now basically intern with good pay at a start up. Combine this with recession paranoia and hearing about hiring freezes In the industry, I practically had a mental breakdown because I feel as if the last 2 years has been a huge waste of time learning math when I should have just bit the bullet and put all my focus into programming, but even if I drop math now and focus of front end, the industry is saturated as fuck with junior devs now racing to get a bite at the tit, and, I still know I won\u2019t feel as full-filled in web as being in The other aforementioned fields of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is when I finally ask, god forbid, has ANYONE been in a situation like this? Do any senior devs out there have any advice of what path that is relatively LOW RISK an insolvent 35 year old with very little time and money but a huge interest for math, games, 3d graphics, ML/AI, digital audio should take? Is it even possible to find a career that intersects of all these fields that you can attain SELF TAUGHT or will I have to work 2 jobs for 2-3 years to pay for school? (keep in mind I am insolvent and can\u2019t take out a loan/ my family has no money as my parents are dead bears and one is an ex addict)? Should I just bite the bullet and learn web dev in whatever free time I have while working 2 jobs just to get my foot in the door or should I focus on passion and interests? Are there even transferable skills for people who have 10 years of audio experience into programming? I know it\u2019s a lot of questions but this is my Hail Mary at this point and I feel so beyond fucked by things I can\u2019t control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any advice of any kind would be amazing and thank you so much for reading all of this if you did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of everything in question form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m 35, an ex-audio engineer/producer that has very little money or means to get anymore than I make (I work 40+ hours a week), I am insolvent and ridden with government/consumer debt and need a better career via the self-taught coding path that is relatively low risk and TIME EFFICIENT that is optimally not web dev to get out of this hell I am in so I can make the life I want for myself and my GF. If it takes 2 years or more THATS FINE, if the learning is difficult THATS FINE. I don\u2019t need to know what language does what for what as I have done all that research, I just need to know what the path of least resistance (not in difficulty but in terms of time and money) that is not web dev related into, a career in software engineering, I can\u2019t waste my time again like I feel I did with learning math first to get into school which I can no longer do because of being fucked over by the government.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;what are the possible 100% self-taught paths that are not Web dev related that I can take that align with my interests? (Games/game engines/3d graphics/ML/AI/Digital audio). Remember loans and school are not an option now it has to work 100% self-taught.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;is game development actually as shitty as everyone says even if I focus on the engine/audio programming and not the design aspect? I have a strong interest but again I am not willing to take a huge risk to get into a career that supposedly pays shit and has long hours only to be potentially laid off is a project doesn\u2019t work.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does anyone else go from audio engineering to programming? Are there even jobs in audio/programming that are lucrative and not super niche? Since I have over a decade in this field I am hoping there are some kind of transferable skills from audio to programming.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;school is not a viable option in the near future so should I bother with math even with my skills? Where can they take me from a self-taught perspective? Can you even get into graphics/ML/AI without a PhD?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

What keeps bothering  me is that you can't \"compile\" it like, for example, cpp code which appears to be much faster. My question is: Is there a point in learning a language that can be compiled (like C++) (are there other advantages other than speed) or to just stick with Python. Also if I were to learn another language, which one should I choose? From research I've done, Rust appears to be the best (compiled language).\n\nRegards",

The most I have ever made in one year was $42,000. I always get promoted into leadership roles wherever I work and I rapidly burn out after a couple years of doing whatever I have done. I'm extremely privileged to be able to keep trying all these things and in no way am I not grateful. \n\nThis year I wound up with an opportunity, my wife and I have saved enough and put ourselves in a situation that I could attend a coding boot camp. \n\nI knew immediately that this was in no way going to be equivalent to a degree, but I have a couple friends that have broken into the field as junior devs and one of them didn't even finish the certification. \n\nThis of course spurred me on to give this thing a shot and I signed up this past January, started in March and now I'm in my last month of boot camp. I'm absolutely floored by this stuff. I have no doubt in my mind that I may be well in over my head. I have somehow maintained a decent grade throughout the course, though I struggle with ADHD, the motivation to learn more and more is only growing and it has helped me to really push through some hard content. \n\nNow that I'm actually starting to grasp the content that I am learning I have come to the conclusion that for the first time in my life I think I may be able to really throw my self into the ocean of possibilities that is Computer science and it's associated professions.

How can I print the value of transportation for the resource named \"seeds\" under the bulding name Plantation below. I thought it would be something like \n\n    def scrapeRetailData(storeName, itemName):\n        url = \"https://www.simcompanies.com/api/v3/0/buildings/1/\"\n        response = requests.get(url)\n        retailData = json.loads(response.text)\n        for item in retailData:\n            if item[\"name\"] == storeName:\n                print(\"Found store: \" + item[\"name\"])\n\nThis works, but I only touch like one layer deep.

At the bottom is the JSON from an api I am working with, I am using &lt;a href=\"https://json2table.com\"&gt;json2table.com&lt;/a&gt; to make it look nicer, if you want to see it in full copy the full text from &lt;a href=\"https://www.simcompanies.com/api/v3/0/buildings/1/\"&gt;https://www.simcompanies.com/api/v3/0/buildings/1/&lt;/a&gt; into the above json2table, and you&amp;#39;ll see what I am looking at. How can I print the value of transportation for the resource named &amp;quot;seeds&amp;quot; under the bulding name Plantation below. I thought it would be something like &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def scrapeRetailData(storeName, itemName):\n    url = &amp;quot;https://www.simcompanies.com/api/v3/0/buildings/1/&amp;quot;\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    retailData = json.loads(response.text)\n    for item in retailData:\n        if item[&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;] == storeName:\n            print(&amp;quot;Found store: &amp;quot; + item[&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;])\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This works, but I only touch like one layer deep. I need to do the above, but then continue to point to a more nested resource/object, next would be &amp;quot;production&amp;quot; and within production &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot; and within &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot; I am looking to get the value of &amp;quot;transportation&amp;quot;. Really I&amp;quot;m going after &amp;quot;anHour&amp;quot; but figure Transportation is easier to describe here and I should be able to extrapolate how to apply it to &amp;quot;anHour&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[\n  {\n    &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Plantation&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;images/landscape/plantation-lvl1.png&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;cost&amp;quot;: 6900,\n    &amp;quot;costUnits&amp;quot;: 2,\n    &amp;quot;wages&amp;quot;: 103.5,\n    &amp;quot;secondsToBuild&amp;quot;: 3600,\n    &amp;quot;category&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;production&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;kind&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;,\n    &amp;quot;robotsNeeded&amp;quot;: 0.5,\n    &amp;quot;realmAvailable&amp;quot;: true,\n    &amp;quot;production&amp;quot;: [\n      {\n        &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: {\n          &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Seeds&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;images/resources/seeds.png&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;db_letter&amp;quot;: 66,\n          &amp;quot;transportation&amp;quot;: 0.1,\n          &amp;quot;retailable&amp;quot;: false,\n          &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;: false,\n          &amp;quot;realmAvailable&amp;quot;: true\n        },\n        &amp;quot;anHour&amp;quot;: 889.6291436724266\n      },\n      {\n        &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: {\n          &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Apples&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;images/resources/apples.png&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;db_letter&amp;quot;: 3,\n          &amp;quot;transportation&amp;quot;: 1,\n          &amp;quot;retailable&amp;quot;: true,\n          &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;: false,\n          &amp;quot;realmAvailable&amp;quot;: true\n        },\n        &amp;quot;anHour&amp;quot;: 202.18844174373334\n      },\n      {\n        &amp;quot;resource&amp;quot;: {\n          &amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Oranges&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;image&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;images/resources/oranges.png&amp;quot;,\n          &amp;quot;db_letter&amp;quot;: 4,\n          &amp;quot;transportation&amp;quot;: 1,\n          &amp;quot;retailable&amp;quot;: true,\n          &amp;quot;research&amp;quot;: false,\n          &amp;quot;realmAvailable&amp;quot;: true\n        },\n        &amp;quot;anHour&amp;quot;: 186.01336640423466\n      },\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
